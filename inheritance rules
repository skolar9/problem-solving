For Compile time exceptions the method in super class should contains super Exception class and method in sub class contain sub exception 
class.
For only Runtime exception every thing is valid
If the compile time exception is declared in super class only then no problem
If the compile time exception is declared in sub class only then super class method should have exception of super class.
